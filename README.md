# Python Learning Journey 🐍

**Current Status:** Grinding through Python Institute PCAP-31-03 Certification

## About This Repo

This is my Python learning workspace as I expand my automation engineering toolkit. Every lab, every mistake, every "wait how does that work?" moment is documented here.

**Background:** Senior Automation Engineer at an MSP specializing in ConnectWise Automate and Rewst workflows. Adding Python to complement my PowerShell/automation stack and deepen my development fundamentals.

**Why Python?** Automation work constantly bumps into Python - API libraries, cross-platform scripting, data processing. Rather than just copy-paste Stack Overflow, I'm building proper foundational knowledge.

## What's Here

### 📚 Certification Labs
Python Institute coursework and exercises covering:
- Object-Oriented Programming (classes, inheritance, composition)
- Generators, iterators, and closures
- File I/O and exception handling
- Standard library modules (os, datetime, etc.)


## Current Learning Focus
- ✅ OOP fundamentals (classes, inheritance, polymorphism)
- ✅ File I/O and buffer management
- ✅ Generators and iterators
- 🔄 Standard library exploration
- ⏳ API development (FastAPI/Flask)
- ⏳ Advanced automation patterns

## Tech Stack
**Production Experience:**
- PowerShell
- Jinja templating
- ConnectWise APIs (Automate, Manage)
- Rewst workflow automation
- MySQL/SQL queries
- REST API integrations

**Expanding Skills:**
- Python 3.x
- Git/GitHub workflows
- OOP design patterns
- Cross-platform automation

## Why This Repo Exists
Transparency in learning. I believe in showing the work, not just the polished results.

If you're also learning Python:
- Browse the labs for examples
- See how concepts build on each other
- Learn from my mistakes (there are many)

## Connect
Based in Southwest Florida. Always happy to talk automation, MSP operations, or why Lord Bertram demands second breakfast at 6 PM. Linked in profile is [here!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/derrick-bennett-94a993a6/) send a connection!
